# Introduction 
Welcome to Azure Terraform foundation landing zone: foundations
The foundation landing zone sets the basics of operations, accounting and auditing and security for a subscription.

# Getting Started
To deploy a landingzone, refer to the setup instructions here: https://github.com/aztfmod/landingzones

Deploy your first landingzone (caf_foundations) 

```
./rover landingzones/landingzone_caf_foundationsv2 plan
```
Review the configuration and if you are ok with it, deploy it by running: 
```
./rover landingzones/landingzone_caf_foundationsv2 apply
```
Have fun playing with the landing zone an once you are done, you can simply delete the deployment using: 
```
./rover landingzones/landingzone_caf_foundationsv2 destroy
```
The foundations will remain on your subscription so next run, you can jump to step 6 directly. 
More details about the landing zone can be found in the landing zone folder ./landingzone_caf_foundations
