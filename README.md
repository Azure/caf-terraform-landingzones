# Cloud Adoption Framework for Azure Terraform landing zones

Microsoft [Cloud Adoption Framework for Azure](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/overview) provides you with guidance and best practices to adopt Azure.

A landing zone is a segment of a cloud environment, that has been pre-provisioned through code, and is dedicated to the support of one or more workloads. Landing zones provide access to foundational tools and controls to establish a compliant place to innovate and build new workloads in the cloud, or to migrate existing workloads to the cloud. Landing zones use defined sets of cloud services and best practices to set you up for success.

We leverage Azure enterprise-scale landing zones and propose a Terraform-native structure, set of mechanisms and artifacts to get started to deploy workloads fast.

You can review the different components parts of the Cloud Adoption Framework for Azure Terraform landing zones and look at the quick intro :vhs:  below:

## Goals

Cloud Adoption Framework for Azure Terraform landing zones is an open-source project equipping the Site Reliability Engineers on Azure with:

* Reusable community artifacts.
* Standardize deployments using battlefield-proven components.
* Accelerate the setup of complex environments on Azure.
* Implement Azure enterprise-scale design and approach with native Terraform and DevOps.
* Propose a prescriptive guidance on how to enable DevOps for infrastructure as code on Microsoft Azure.
* Develop configuration-based "infrastructure-as-data" as a democratization of "infrastructure-as-code".

## :rocket: Getting started

When starting an enterprise deployment, we recommend you start creating a configuration repository where you craft the configuration files for your environments.

The best way to start is to clone the [starter repository](https://github.com/Azure/caf-terraform-landingzones-starter) and getting started with the configuration files, you can find a quick [onboarding video here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5BXm30IpdY)
