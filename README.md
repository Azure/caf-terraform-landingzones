# Azure Cloud Adoption Framework landing zones for Terraform

Microsoft [Cloud Adoption Framework for Azure](https://aka.ms/caf) provides you with guidance and best practices to adopt Azure.

A landing zone is a segment of a cloud environment, that has been preprovisioned through code, and is dedicated to the support of one or more workloads. Landing zones provide access to foundational tools and controls to establish a compliant place to innovate and build new workloads in the cloud, or to migrate existing workloads to the cloud. Landing zones use defined sets of cloud services and best practices to set you up for success.

## Goals

Cloud Adoption Framework for Azure Terraform landing zones is an Open Source project with the following objectives:

* Enable the community with a set of sample reusable landing zones.
* Standardize deployments using battlefield-proven components.
* Accelerate the setup of complex environments on Azure.
* Propose an enterprise-grade approach to adopting Terraform on Microsoft Azure using Cloud Adoption Framework.
* Propose a prescriptive guidance on how to enable DevOps for infrastructure as code on Microsoft Azure.
* Foster a community of Azure *Terraformers* using a common set of practices and sharing best practices.

## Getting started

See our [Getting Started](./documentation/getting_started/getting_started.md)

## Documentation

More details on how to develop, deploy and operate with landing zones can be found in the reference section [here](./documentation/README.md)

## Sample landing zones

Currently we provide you with the following sample landing zones:

| Name                                                                       | Purpose | Depends on | Tested with launchpad
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------- | -- | -- |
| [landingzone_caf_foundations](./landingzones/landingzone_caf_foundations)  | setup all the fundamentals for a subscription (logging, accounting, security.). You can find all details of the caf_foundations landing zone [Here](./landingzones/landingzone_caf_foundations/readme.md) | N/A | launchpad_opensource_light, launchpad_opensource |
| [landingzone_hub_spoke](./landingzones/landingzone_hub_spoke)              | example of [hub and spoke environment](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/reference-architectures/hybrid-networking/hub-spoke) documentation [here](./landingzones/landingzone_hub_spoke/readme.md) | landingzone_caf_foundations | launchpad_opensource_light, launchpad_opensource |

| [landingzone_vdc_demo](./landingzones/landingzone_vdc_demo)                | setup a demo environment of a hub-spoke topology including shared services, as well as various DMZ (ingress, egress, transit). You can find all details of the vdc_demo landing zone [Here](./landingzones/landingzone_vdc_demo/readme.md)| landingzone_caf_foundations | launchpad_opensource_light, launchpad_opensource |
| [landingzone_secure_vnet_dmz](./landingzones/landingzone_secure_vnet_dmz)  | (preview) this is an early implementation of the reference architecture [secure_vnet_dmz](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/azure/architecture/reference-architectures/dmz/secure-vnet-dmz). This is a work in progress used to illustrate landing zone creation process as described [here](./documentation/code_architecture/how_to_code_a_landingzone.md) . You can find all details of the secure vnet dmz landing zone [Here](./landingzones/landingzone_secure_vnet_dmz/readme.md)| landingzone_caf_foundations | launchpad_opensource_light, launchpad_opensource |
| [landingzone_starter](./landingzones/landingzone_starter)                  | this is an empty landing zones to use as a template to develop a level 2 landing zone. You can find all details of the starter landing zone [Here](./landingzones/landingzone_starter/readme.md)| landingzone_caf_foundations | launchpad_opensource_light, launchpad_opensource |
