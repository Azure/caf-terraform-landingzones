## :rocket: Getting started

When starting an enterprise deployment, we recommend you start creating a configuration repository where you craft the configuration files for your environments.

The best way to start is to clone the [platform starter repository](https://github.com/Azure/caf-terraform-landingzones-platform-starter) and getting started with the configuration files.
